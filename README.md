# CSE 204
This was the sessional course for CSE 203 (Data Structures and Algorithm)
For the Data structure portion I used "java" for the implementations and for Algoritms part, I opted for C++
Bear in mind that all the solutions provided here are solutions of my own and they may not always be the most optimised.
I have added my obtained marks for each assignment so that you can get an idea of how accurate my code was. The instances where I got 1 marks less than full marks, were because I could not answer one/two questions our course teacher asked me. However the code was just fine
